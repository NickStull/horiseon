1: Code Refactor: horiseon project.
A website for SEO Company Horiseon. 

## Description 

This project includes changes to the the clients HTML and CSS. The requirements given by the client are as follows:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
1. WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
2. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
3. WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
4. WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
5. WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The main task given was to make their site meets accessibility standards. This was achieved in a few ways. First was to make sure all images in the page had an alt text accesible by screen readers. There were also several sections of the html that solely used Divs without any semantic HTML elements. A few that were changed include the navigation, the main content of the page and the header and footer. By adding back in these semantic tags we are allowing the accesibility tools to better navigate throught the page. The page was also given an appropriate title. This satisfies requirements 1, 3, and 5.

Next task was to clean up the code for future work. This was an important step in order to cut down the needed time to make future changes and improvements. There were a few hanging divs that were unnecessary. These were cleaned up and given a better structure that was easier to read. There were also a couple of heading tags that were out of order. These were changed to follow a more appropriate flow. In addition to the changes to the HTML, there were changes also made to the CSS. The most important changes were done to cater to the changes in html tags and syntax, but there were also some CSS Rules that were able to be consolidated. This left the stylesheet in a better state for future projects. This satisfies requirements 2 and 4.

For further detail in to some of the changes made, please see comments within index.html and style.css.
